# Linear-Regression-Plotter
**Linear Regression Model and Plotter for a given sample dateset.**


The provided code performs linear regression on a dataset by fitting a line to the data points. It uses the normal equation method to calculate the regression coefficients. The code reads the data, preprocesses it, adds an intercept term to the input variables, calculates the coefficients, and then visualizes the data along with the regression line using matplotlib.
