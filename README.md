# Linear-Regression-Plotter
**Linear Regression Model and Plotter for a given sample dateset.**


This python program performs linear regression on a dataset by fitting a line to the data points. It uses the normal equation method to calculate the regression coefficients. The code reads the data, preprocesses it, adds an intercept term to the input variables, calculates the coefficients, and then visualizes the data along with the regression line using matplotlib.

The program uses the following libraries:

1. `pandas`: It is used for data manipulation and analysis. In this code, it is used to read the data from a CSV file and store it in a DataFrame.

2. `numpy`: It is a library for numerical operations in Python. It provides support for mathematical functions and operations on arrays. Here, it is used to reshape the input data and perform linear algebraic calculations.

3. `matplotlib.pyplot`: It is a plotting library in Python used for data visualization. It provides a variety of functions to create plots, charts, and graphs. In this code, it is used to plot the data points and the regression line.
