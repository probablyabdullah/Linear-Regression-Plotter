This program performs linear regression on a dataset and then visualizes the data and the resulting regression line.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The first four lines import the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`) and set the default figure size for plots.

2. The next line reads the data from a CSV file named 'data.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame called `data`.

3. The following two lines extract the input variable `X` and the target variable `Y` from the DataFrame. `X` represents the independent variable(s), and `Y` represents the dependent variable(s).

4. The next line adds a column of ones to `X` to account for the intercept term in the linear regression equation. This is done by using `np.hstack()` to horizontally stack an array of ones with `X`.

5. The code then calculates the coefficients of the linear regression model using the normal equation approach in linear algebra. It uses `np.linalg.inv()` to calculate the inverse of the matrix product of `X` and its transpose, and then performs matrix multiplication to obtain the coefficients (`beta`) using the dot product of matrices.

6. The next three lines print the matrices `X`, `X.T` (transpose of `X`), and the coefficients `m` and `c`.

7. The code extracts the slope (`m`) and intercept (`c`) from the `beta` coefficients.

8. It then plots the original data points as a scatter plot using `plt.scatter()`, and overlays the regression line by plotting `X` multiplied by `beta` using `plt.plot()`. The regression line is colored red.

9. Finally, `plt.show()` is used to display the plot with the data points and regression line.

Overall, this code performs linear regression on a given dataset and visualizes the relationship between the independent and dependent variables using a scatter plot and a regression line.
